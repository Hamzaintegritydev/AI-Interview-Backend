For example, what technologies or frameworks are you using on the front end, and how are you integrating with the AI components?\n",
    "Okay, so you're using HS, Deepgram, and ElevenLabs by RTC. That's quite a stack! Could you walk me through how you're integrating those different technologies? Like, how does the data flow between the front end, Deepgram for voice recognition, and ElevenLabs for the AI voice? And what kind of data are you passing around at each stage?\n"
