    "yeah I am using front and for exist and packet for node Jason Express Jazz and Momo dp for database and for PDF file download JS PDF third party package",
    "sure that when the candidate then the form and submit the button the instruction would be saved in our PDF generates on candidate 5 to get in our centre and in this project I will also integrated real times scanner so you can scan our",
    "yeah is this for I am using third party packages of JavaScript to use that is like candidates comes his form then we have scanner once can and then we approved it",
    "in proper words this is not call scanner I think this is call for QR code like we have lots of QR code for registration so that's why I never in our sheet be user can come and except our QR code in our system so that we approve that he is our system and he is go to head",
    "yeah with clay I am using JavaScript third party packages for QR code like of react you are for JavaScript so in this project I will very tight challenges for the security reason so that's why I am working on this project mode for security",
    "basically when the QR code scans the user details this If in case there are we have leaked some QR code for user details with this so this is very dangerous for us that's why we are working on this",

      "score": 2,
      "analysis": "The candidate demonstrated basic familiarity with web development stacks (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB) and third-party packages for QR code and PDF generation. However, explanations were superficial and lacked detail on implementation or troubleshooting. The candidate was unable to clarify which encryption methods or libraries were used or how security was integrated, leaving doubts about the depth of their technical skills."
    },
    "communicationAssessment": {
      "score": 1.5,
      "analysis": "Communication throughout the interview was poor. The candidate struggled to clearly articulate thoughts, often using incomplete or confusing phrases. Answers lacked logical flow, and technical explanations were disorganized. This would likely hinder teamwork, knowledge sharing, and ability to work effectively in a professional software engineering environment."
    },
    "culturalFitAssessment": {
      "score": 2.5,
      "analysis": "The candidate expressed a passion for coding and showed some initiative in building projects beyond coursework. However, the inability to communicate clearly and the lack of detailed, thoughtful answers raise concerns about collaboration and learning potential in a team-oriented culture."
    },
    "problemSolvingAssessment": {
      "score": 2,
      "analysis": "The candidate was able to identify the security risk of leaking QR codes and described working toward a solution, but failed to concretely describe problem-solving approaches, debug strategies, or specific steps taken to resolve technical issues. Answers lacked details showing structured thinking or systematic troubleshooting."

    "recommendation": "Reject",
    "feedback": "Thank you for sharing your project experience and discussing the integration of multiple technologies. While your enthusiasm for software development is noted, your answers lacked the clarity and detail necessary for an entry-level engineering position. You struggled to explain your technical approach, especially concerning security and data flow, and communication barriers made it difficult to assess your understanding. Improving your ability to clearly describe projects, specify technologies used, and articulate your problem-solving process will greatly increase your chances in future interviews. More practice with technical English and targeted preparation will help you demonstrate your skills more effectively.",
    "developmentPlan": [
      "Practice describing project experiences using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method to structure your answers.",
      "Work on clear, concise communication in English, focusing on practicing technical terminology.",
      "Deepen your understanding of technologies you've worked with—especially security basics such as encryption, authentication, and safe handling of user data.",
      "Prepare specific examples of how you solved problems, what libraries you used, and why you selected them.",
      "Participate in mock interviews or peer review sessions to gain feedback on communication and technical explanations."
