    "technicalAssessment": {
      "score": 1,
      "analysis": "The candidate showed basic familiarity with JavaScript, ExpressJS, and a third-party PDF library, but struggled to clearly articulate technical decisions or processes. No details were provided on core software engineering topics like validation, error handling, or logic flow."
    },
    "communicationAssessment": {
      "score": 1,
      "analysis": "Communication was fragmented, with frequent grammatical errors and incomplete thoughts. The candidate struggled to convey ideas clearly and could not fluently discuss their experience."
    },
    "culturalFitAssessment": {
      "score": 2,
      "analysis": "The candidate appeared eager and positive about entering the software engineering field, but did not demonstrate curiosity, collaboration, or learning drive typically desired for team environments."
    },
    "problemSolvingAssessment": {
      "score": 1,
      "analysis": "There was no evidence of structured problem solving. The candidate could not answer scenario-based or follow-up technical questions, failing to demonstrate an ability to break down or address engineering challenges."

    "recommendation": "Reject",
    "feedback": "Thank you for interviewing with us. While you have started exploring web technologies and building practical applications, there are significant gaps in your ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and provide detailed explanations for your engineering decisions. For entry-level positions, we look for candidates who can articulate their process and show foundational strength in common tasks like validation and error handling. We encourage you to focus on deepening your technical understanding and practicing how to discuss your work clearly in interviews.",
    "developmentPlan": [
      "Practice explaining your projects in clear, concise language, focusing on technical choices and your reasoning.",
      "Deepen your understanding of common web development tasks such as form validation, error handling, and backend logic.",
      "Conduct mock interviews or present projects to peers to build confidence and fluency in communication."
